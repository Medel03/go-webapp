#### 6. **`.gitignore`**
This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore when committing changes. For Go projects, you generally want to ignore the following:

```gitignore
# Ignore Go binary files
*.exe
*.out
*.test

# Ignore vendor directory (if you're not using vendoring)
vendor/

# Ignore Go modules
go.sum
